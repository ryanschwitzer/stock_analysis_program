## About the Project

I decided to take the idea of the project and complete it from scratch to maximize my learning. I did not use Juypter, it was done in VS Studio. This project showcases my Python skills and data science knowledge, leveraging libraries like `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. Perfect for anyone looking to quickly analyze stock data and make informed decisions.
