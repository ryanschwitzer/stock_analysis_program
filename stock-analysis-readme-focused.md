## About the Project
I decided to take the idea of the project and complete it from scratch to maximize my learning. I did not use Juypter, it was done in VS Studio. This project showcases my Python skills and data science knowledge, leveraging libraries like yfinance, pandas, and matplotlib. Perfect for anyone looking to quickly analyze stock data and make informed decisions.
